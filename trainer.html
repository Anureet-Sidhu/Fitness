        </div>
        <ul>
            <ol>If you want to challenge your balance, improve your agility.</ol>
            <ol>Give your quads a workout,give backwards pedalling a go.</ol>
            <ol>You’ll immediately feel the difference as
            your body changes the way it uses its muscles to work.</ol>
            <ol>Tip: For a real thigh burner, let go of the handles and squat down into your legs.</ol>

          <div class="cardio">
            <b>Add some intervals to boost your fitness:</b>
</div>
        <ul>
           <ol>To add intervals to your cross trainer workout, simply add periods of faster pedalling.</ol>
            <ol>After a five-minute warm-up, pedal for one minute as fast as you can.</ol>
            <ol> Use the next two to three minutes to recover at a normal pace, then repeat. </ol>
             <ol>As you get fitter, you can increase the amount of time you spend pedalling at
                 top speed.</ol>
        </ul>
        <div class="cardio">
            <b> Increase the resistance to improve your strength:</b>
</div>
        <ul>
           <ol>Higher the resistance, the more effort your body needs to exert.</ol>
            <ol>The more strength you build and the more kilojoules you burn.</ol>
            <ol> Use the next two to three minutes to recover at a normal pace, then repeat. </ol>
             <ol>So up that dial and keep going!</ol>

            <ol>By strengthening your core muscles – the abdominals, lower back, thoracic and cervical region.</ol>
            <ol> By letting go of the handles, you force yourself to
            engage your abdominal and core muscles.</ol>
            </ul>
           <div class="cardio">
            <b> Push and pull on the handlebars for upper body toning:</b>

            <ol>To tone your arms, chest, shoulders and back, simply grab onto the handlebars, stop using your legs to
            pedal, and begin pushing and pulling with your arms to power the machine.</ol>
            <ol>Ensure you keep a straight back to
            avoid injury.</ol>
            <ol>You may have to drop the resistance to do so.</ol>
              <ol>The push motion will work your chest and triceps
            more, while the pull motion will give your biceps, shoulders and back more of a workout.</ol>
              <ol>Intersperse two to
            three intervals of upper body training throughout your workout for the best results.</ol>
