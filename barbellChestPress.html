        <div class="cardio">The bench press is an upper-body weight training exercise in which the trainee presses a
            weight upwards while lying on a weight training bench. The exercise uses the pectoralis major, the anterior
            deltoids, and the triceps, among other stabilizing muscles. A barbell is generally used to hold the weight,
            but a pair of dumbbells can also be used.

            The barbell bench press is one of three lifts in the sport of powerlifting alongside the deadlift and squat,
            and is the only lift in the sport of Paralympic powerlifting. It is also used extensively in weight
            training, bodybuilding, and other types of training to develop the chest muscles.

				<b><u>MOVEMENT:</u></b>
				 <br/>
				 The person performing the exercise lies on their back on a bench with a barbell grasped in both hands. They lower the barbell to chest level, then press the barbell upwards, extending the arms until the elbows are locked out. This is one repetition (rep).

<b>Powerlifting:</b> Take position on a flat bench with body weight resting on buttocks and upper traps having an arched back and feet driven into the floor. Movement requires the weight to be taken at full arms' length, lowered to upper torso, paused, and then lifted to starting position.
