				<p>It started in operation 2 years after the gym, in 2008 by our owner. Although he started out selling sports equipment from the trunk of his car, his passion couldn't be contained and the company expanded to include multiple retail stores in Southern Ontario including the one in our gym. We continue to provide outstanding selection, pricing and service to its loyal Customers across Ontario.</p>

				<p>We believe team gyms are unique because they create a sense of community for the players, their families and fans. Yet every community needs a centre – a place they can go for resources, counsel, expertise and support. That’s where we come in. We offer the broadest selection of the best brands for team sports, and hire only knowledgeable staff who are passionate about helping you raise your game.</p></div>
