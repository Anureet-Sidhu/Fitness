        <div class="treadmill"> Treadmills are pieces of exercise equipment where a user can run, jog, or walk on a flat or
            inclined surface while physically remaining in the same place. Treadmills are comprised of a wide conveyer
            belt that is commonly driven at configurable speeds by an electric power motor. Because treadmills are
            flexible and efficient workouts for use in public gyms or privately at home, the treadmill remains the best
            selling fixture of exercise equipment for sale.

            Treadmills vary among the features that they provide, but their dimensions are commonly 81” (206 cm) long,
            34” (86 cm) wide, with a height of 55” (140) cm. ‍<br><br>
